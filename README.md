### NAME
MLP2 - Multi-Layer Perceptron with two layers

### DESCRIPTION

This is a demonstration of Multi-Layer Perceptron with two layers on the XOR
problem in the C language.  It is very simple, very small neural network.
However, the backpropagation algorithm is complete.  The demo relies on the
use of preprocessor to beautify the math.  The code can be easily extended to
bigger MLP topologies and real data.

Because the XOR network and data are so tiny, the program requirements differ a
lot from more typical bigger neural networks.  Compiler optimizations might
have different results than usually, or the double can be faster then float...
